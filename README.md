# GSoC_2020_MinorityMessagesAndDemocrats:

  The 2020 Google Summer of Code project "Understanding the Use of Racial, Gender, and Sexual Minority Social Media Messages by Democratic Politicians and their Electoral Implications" is contributed by Henry Smith with [Red Hen Lab](http://www.redhenlab.org/). Work on the project is completed under the mentorship of [Dr. Jungeock Joo](http://home.jsjoo.com/) and [Sumit Vohra](https://in.linkedin.com/in/sumit-vohra-224484a0).

## Project Directory:

- [electoral_outcomes_data](https://github.com/smithhenryd/GSoC_2020_MinorityMessagesAndDemocrats-/tree/master/electoral_outcomes_data) includes data collected from [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Election_results,_2018) summarizing 2018 U.S. midterm election outcomes. The current data details primary and general election outcomes in racially and ethnically diverse congressional districts, measured by the proportion of individuals that identify as people of color (POC).

- [imgs_data](https://github.com/smithhenryd/GSoC_2020_MinorityMessagesAndDemocrats-/tree/master/imgs_data) contains information pertaining to the 2018 Facebook images dataset collected by Dr. Jungseock Joo and his colleagues. The dataset consists of images shared on Facebook from January 1 - November 5, 2018 by U.S. politicians who competed for the U.S. House, Senate, and state governorships during the 2018 general election.


## Background and Motivation:

  The importance of minority voters is not new to the Democratic party: a 2017 poll of registered voters by the Pew Research Institute of U.S. Politics and Policy estimated that only fifty-nine percent of self-identified Democrats/lean Democrats label themselves as white, compared to the eighty-nine percent of Republicans/lean Republicans. This figure is down from an estimated sixty-seven percent in 2007 and seventy-five percent in 1997. The same report approximates that black voters  constitute nineteen percent of this Democratic base, Hispanic voters twelve percent, and Asian/other racial minorities constitute ten percent [6]. 

  Moreover, recent elections suggest the emergence of the LGBT community, which we classify as gender and sexual minorities, as one of the most solid Democratic voting blocs. Exit polling by NBC following the 2018 midterm elections indicated that while LGBT voters constituted only six percent of the electorate, upwards of eighty-two percent of these voters supported the Democratic candidate [1]. 
  
  Despite the distinct importance of these groups to the Democratic party, it is not clear that the party knows how to effectively mobilize minority voters. This harrowing reality came to the forefront of the news cycle following a decade-low black voter turnout during the 2016 election [4]. In response to this fall in turnout, to which many have attributed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s loss, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) pledged $2.5 million for the funding of programs to increase minority turnout during the 2018 midterm elections [3].

  Of particular interest to our research is how politicians themselves aim to mobilize these communities through social media. Past research has underscored the importance of social media as spaces for racial, gender, and sexual minority groups. In conflict with the narrative that a lack of access to technology divides disadvantaged racial minority groups, a recent study has shown that online platforms in fact embolden social networks between these groups [2]. Likewise, it is estimated that eighty percent of LGBT adults engage on at least one social media website, which is much greater than the fifty-eight percent of the general public [5]. 
  
  Keeping this in mind, we seek to answer the following questions:
1. How do Democratic politicians present themselves to racial, gender, and sexual minority groups on social media platforms through visual content?
2. Which traits displayed in these images are perceived most positively/negatively by minority voters? 
3. How do visual messages predict primary election outcomes in diverse electoral districts?
